Mastering curl for CTF Challenges: A Step-by-Step Guide to Finding Flags
As a cybersecurity enthusiast, Iâ€™ve been diving into Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges to sharpen my skills. Recently, I tackled a web-based challenge that required using curl to authenticate to a server, manage session cookies, and send JSON POST requests to retrieve a flag. In this post, Iâ€™ll walk you through the process I followed to solve the challenge on the server 83.136.251.68:48581, sharing detailed notes on using curl effectively. Whether youâ€™re new to CTFs or looking to brush up on your curl skills, this guide has you covered!

The Challenge Setup
The goal of this CTF challenge was to interact with a web application, authenticate using the credentials admin:admin, and use a search function to find a flag in the format FLAG{...}. The search function required a JSON POST request to /search.php, and I had a valid session cookie: PHPSESSID=hnjcoa6bvghqatlscamgvmh38h. The challenge provided a clue: searching for "london" returned ["London (UK)"], but I needed to find the right search term to get the flag. Letâ€™s break down how I used curl to solve this.

What is curl?
curl (Client URL) is a powerful command-line tool for making HTTP requests. Itâ€™s a go-to tool for CTF players, pentesters, and developers because it lets you craft precise requests, manage cookies, and inspect responses. In this challenge, I used curl to:

Authenticate to the server and obtain a session cookie.
Send a JSON POST request to the search endpoint to find the flag.
Below are my detailed notes on each step, with explanations of the curl flags and options I used.

Step 1: Authenticating to the Server
To interact with the web application, I first needed to log in and obtain an authenticated session cookie (PHPSESSID). The login form expected a POST request with the credentials username=admin&password=admin.

Command
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
curl -X POST -d "username=admin&password=admin" -u admin:admin -c cookies.txt http://83.136.251.68:48581/
What Each Flag Does
-X POST:
Tells curl to use the HTTP POST method. The login form requires POST to submit the credentials.
Without this, curl defaults to GET, which would fail.
-d "username=admin&password=admin":
Sends the form data in the request body, mimicking filling out the username and password fields.
The format key=value&key=value is application/x-www-form-urlencoded, the standard for HTML forms.
In Windows Command Prompt, I used quotes ("...") to avoid parsing issues.
-u admin:admin:
Adds HTTP Basic Authentication with the username admin and password admin.
This sends an Authorization: Basic ... header with the Base64-encoded credentials (admin:admin becomes YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=).
The challenge required Basic Auth for some endpoints, though the login step might work without it.
-c cookies.txt:
Saves cookies from the response to cookies.txt.
After a successful login, the server sends a Set-Cookie header (e.g., Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=hnjcoa6bvghqatlscamgvmh38h; path=/), which this flag stores.
http://83.136.251.68:48581/:
The login endpoint URL. If this fails (e.g., 404 Not Found), try /login or /login.php.
Alternative: View the Cookie Directly
To see the Set-Cookie header without saving to a file:

bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
curl -X POST -d "username=admin&password=admin" -u admin:admin -i http://83.136.251.68:48581/
-i:
Includes response headers in the output.
Look for Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=hnjcoa6bvghqatlscamgvmh38h; path=/ to get the cookie value.
What to Expect
If successful, cookies.txt will contain the PHPSESSID.
The response body should include <em>Type a city name and hit <strong>Enter</strong></em>, confirming youâ€™re logged in.
Troubleshooting
401 Unauthorized: Double-check the credentials or remove -u admin:admin if Basic Auth isnâ€™t needed.
404 Not Found: The login endpoint might be /login or /login.php. Adjust the URL and retry.
No Cookie: Login failed. Check the response for error messages.
Step 2: Sending the Search Request with the Cookie
With the session cookie (PHPSESSID=hnjcoa6bvghqatlscamgvmh38h), I could interact with the search function by sending a JSON POST request to /search.php. The challenge provided a clue: searching for "london" returned ["London (UK)"].

Command
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
curl -X POST -d "{\"search\":\"london\"}" -b "PHPSESSID=hnjcoa6bvghqatlscamgvmh38h" -u admin:admin -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://83.136.251.68:48581/search.php
What Each Flag Does
-X POST:
Specifies a POST request, as required by the search function.
-d "{\"search\":\"london\"}":
Sends the JSON payload {"search":"london"} in the request body.
In Windows Command Prompt, I escaped the inner quotes (\") to ensure the JSON is parsed correctly.
-b "PHPSESSID=hnjcoa6bvghqatlscamgvmh38h":
Includes the session cookie in the Cookie header.
This authenticates the request, allowing access to the search function without re-entering credentials.
-u admin:admin:
Adds Basic Auth. The challenge required this for some endpoints, but if the cookie alone works, you can omit it.
-H "Content-Type: application/json":
Sets the Content-Type header to application/json, indicating the payload is JSON.
The challenge confirmed this header is necessary.
http://83.136.251.68:48581/search.php:
The search endpoint URL.
Alternative: Use a Cookie File
If you saved the cookie to cookies.txt:

bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
curl -X POST -d "{\"search\":\"london\"}" -b cookies.txt -u admin:admin -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://83.136.251.68:48581/search.php
-b cookies.txt:
Reads cookies from cookies.txt and includes them in the request.
What to Expect
The response should be:

text

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
["London (UK)"]
This isnâ€™t the flag (weâ€™re looking for FLAG{...}), so we need to try different search terms.

Troubleshooting
A valid authentication cookie is required!:
The cookie has expired. Re-authenticate to get a new one (see Step 1).
401 Unauthorized:
Keep -u admin:admin if required, or remove it if the cookie alone is sufficient.
Invalid JSON:
The server might return text/html instead of application/json. Use -v to inspect:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
curl -v -X POST -d "{\"search\":\"london\"}" -b "PHPSESSID=hnjcoa6bvghqatlscamgvmh38h" -u admin:admin -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://83.136.251.68:48581/search.php
Step 3: Finding the Flag by Adjusting the Search Term
The response ["London (UK)"] was a clue, not the flag. I needed to guess the correct search term to reveal the flag. Hereâ€™s how I iterated through different terms.

Command Template
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
curl -X POST -d "{\"search\":\"<term>\"}" -b "PHPSESSID=hnjcoa6bvghqatlscamgvmh38h" -u admin:admin -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://83.136.251.68:48581/search.php
Replace <term> with different search terms.
Terms I Tried
"London (UK)":
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
curl -X POST -d "{\"search\":\"London (UK)\"}" -b "PHPSESSID=hnjcoa6bvghqatlscamgvmh38h" -u admin:admin -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://83.136.251.68:48581/search.php
"London Bridge":
bash

Collapse

Copy
curl -X POST -d "{\"search\":\"London Bridge\"}" -b "PHPSESSID=hnjcoa6bvghqatlscamgvmh38h" -u admin:admin -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://83.136.251.68:48581/search.php
"flag":
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
curl -X POST -d "{\"search\":\"flag\"}" -b "PHPSESSID=hnjcoa6bvghqatlscamgvmh38h" -u admin:admin -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://83.136.251.68:48581/search.php
"London, UK":
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
curl -X POST -d "{\"search\":\"London, UK\"}" -b "PHPSESSID=hnjcoa6bvghqatlscamgvmh38h" -u admin:admin -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://83.136.251.68:48581/search.php
"Big Ben":
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
curl -X POST -d "{\"search\":\"Big Ben\"}" -b "PHPSESSID=hnjcoa6bvghqatlscamgvmh38h" -u admin:admin -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://83.136.251.68:48581/search.php
"Thames":
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
curl -X POST -d "{\"search\":\"Thames\"}" -b "PHPSESSID=hnjcoa6bvghqatlscamgvmh38h" -u admin:admin -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://83.136.251.68:48581/search.php
What to Look For
The flag should be in the format:

text

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
["FLAG{london_something}"]
or

text

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
{"result": "FLAG{london_something}"}
Troubleshooting
No Flag:
Try other London-related terms (e.g., "Buckingham Palace", "Tower of London") or CTF-related terms (e.g., "secret", "key").
Content-Type Mismatch:
If the response isnâ€™t JSON, use -v to inspect the raw output.
Bonus curl Tips
Follow Redirects:
Some login forms redirect after authentication. Use -L to follow redirects:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
curl -X POST -d "username=admin&password=admin" -u admin:admin -c cookies.txt -L http://83.136.251.68:48581/
Verbose Output:
Use -v to debug:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
curl -v -X POST -d "{\"search\":\"london\"}" -b "PHPSESSID=hnjcoa6bvghqatlscamgvmh38h" -u admin:admin -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://83.136.251.68:48581/search.php
Test Without Headers:
The challenge suggested trying without the cookie or Content-Type:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
curl -X POST -d "{\"search\":\"london\"}" http://83.136.251.68:48581/search.php
This should return A valid authentication cookie is required!.
Windows Command Prompt:
Escape quotes in JSON payloads (\") to avoid parsing errors.
If commands fail, wrap them in quotes or use a script file.
Wrapping Up
Using curl to solve this CTF challenge was a great learning experience! I started by authenticating to the server to get a session cookie, then used that cookie to send JSON POST requests to the search endpoint. The clue ["London (UK)"] led me to try different search terms until I found the flag. If youâ€™re working on a similar challenge, I hope these notes help you navigate the process. Let me know in the comments if you have other curl tips or CTF strategies to share!

Happy hacking! ðŸš€
